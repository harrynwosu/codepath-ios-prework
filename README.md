## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Snapchat
   - Automatically deleting past messages
   - Tracking occurences of sceenshots and sending the other person a notification when one is taken
2. Whatsapp
   - The ability to set media to view once and completely disable screenshots/screenrecording on these media
   - Archiving chats and muting notifications from the archived chats
3. Instagram
   - Vanish mode on chats
   - Seamlessly connecting a user's Threads account to their Instagram account
   - The ability to share even music on the new Instagram notes feature.

An app idea of mine would be a travel planning app. Planning work/vacation trips usually requires doing research about individual parts of your trip on different websites/apps. My idea is to implement an app that has every part of your travel incorporated into one single app, ranging from flights booking, car rentals, hotel bookings, restaurant reservations, and other fun things to do around your destination area like amusement parks or museum visiting. This could greatly improve trip planning since all aspects of the trip will be all in one loctaion.

## Notes

Had to spend some time searching for some menus we needed that were not well described in the walkthrough document.
