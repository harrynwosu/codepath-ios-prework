### Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

### App Brainstorming
1. Snapchat
   - Automatically deleting past messages
   - Tracking occurences of sceenshots and sending the other person a notification when one is taken
2. Whatsapp
   - The ability to set media to view once and completely disable screenshots/screenrecording on these media
   - Archiving chats and muting notifications from the archived chats
3. Instagram
   - Vanish mode on chats
   - Seamlessly connecting a user's Threads account to their Instagram account
